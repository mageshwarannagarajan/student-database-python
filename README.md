# Student Database Management System (Python)

A **CLI-based Student Database Management System** built using Python. This project allows users to manage student records efficiently through the command line by performing CRUD operations with persistent file-based storage.

---

## 📌 Features

* Add new student records
* Update existing student details
* Delete student records
* Search for a student by ID
* Display all student records
* Persistent storage using **JSON file handling**
* Input validation for reliable data entry
* Clean and modular code using **OOPS principles**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3
* File Handling (JSON)
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)
* Command Line Interface (CLI)

---

## 📂 Project Structure

```
StudentDatabase/
│── student_db.py        # Main application file
│── README.md            # Project documentation
│── students.json        # Auto-generated data file (ignored in Git)
```
